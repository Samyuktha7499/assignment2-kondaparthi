  # code fencing 
  The divide-and-conquer paradigm is often used to find an optimal solution of a problem. Its basic idea is to decompose a given problem into two or more similar, but simpler, subproblems, to solve them in turn, and to compose their solutions to solve the given problem. Problems of sufficient simplicity are solved directly. For example, to sort a given list of n natural numbers, split it into two lists of about n/2 numbers each, sort each of them in turn, and interleave both results appropriately to obtain the sorted version of the given list (see the picture). This approach is known as the merge sort algorithm.

```
  int m, n;
vector<long long> dp_before(n), dp_cur(n);

long long C(int i, int j);

// compute dp_cur[l], ... dp_cur[r] (inclusive)
void compute(int l, int r, int optl, int optr) {
    if (l > r)
        return;

    int mid = (l + r) >> 1;
    pair<long long, int> best = {LLONG_MAX, -1};

    for (int k = optl; k <= min(mid, optr); k++) {
        best = min(best, {(k ? dp_before[k - 1] : 0) + C(k, mid), k});
    }

    dp_cur[mid] = best.first;
    int opt = best.second;

    compute(l, mid - 1, optl, opt);
    compute(mid + 1, r, opt, optr);
}

int solve() {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        dp_before[i] = C(0, i);

    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        compute(0, n - 1, 0, n - 1);
        dp_before = dp_cur;
    }

    return dp_before[n - 1];
}
